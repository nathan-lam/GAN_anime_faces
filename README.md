# GAN_faces

Personal project to create a model that can generate faces using a GAN set up

Most attempts will have plots displaying loss per epoch, performance of the discriminator's performance, and time per epoch

My first dataset can be found here  
https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces  
Each image is a 64x64 image in color (RGB)  



# Goals
* To increase the quality of the generated images
* To automatically scrape and crop any set of images (to automatically make myself a new dataset to train with)
* Find a method to read in high density data that wont take forever to load

# Currently Working on
* Im working to cram a 20GB dataset into a matrix object (working to train with higher resolution images) and my estimated time is 62 hours in total
