# GAN_faces

Personal project to create a model that can generate faces using a GAN set up


Each image is a 64x64 image in color (RGB)  
Most attempts will have plots displaying loss per epoch and performance of the discriminator's performance


Currently, I am tweeking the model to improve the quality the generator produces
