# GAN_faces

Personal project to create a model that can generate faces using a GAN set up

Most attempts will have plots displaying loss per epoch, performance of the discriminator's performance, and time per epoch

I use several datasets in this repository
* https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces  
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models
* Youtube thumbnail dataset I curated myself



# Goals
* To learn how to use tensorflow
* To learn how a GANs model works


# Currently Working on
* Creating a dataset of youtube thumbnails
